    "summary": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing on single-cell gene expressions (scRNA-seq) have enabled transcriptome profil-ing on individual cells from complex samples. A common goal in scRNA-seq data analysis is to discover and character-ise cell types, typically through clustering methods. The quality of the clustering therefore plays a critical role in biological discovery. While numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed for scRNA-seq data, fundamentally they all rely on a similarity metric for categorizing individual cells. Although several studies have compared the performance of various clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data, currently there is no benchmark of different similarity metrics and their influ-ence on scRNA-seq data clustering. Here, we compared a panel of similarity metrics on clustering a collection of anno-tated scRNA-seq datasets. Within each dataset, a stratified subsampling procedure was applied and an array of evalua-tion measures was employed to assess the similarity metrics. This produced a highly reliable and reproducible consen-sus on their performance assessment. Overall, we found that correlation-based metrics (e.g. Pearson’s correlation) out-performed distance-based metrics (e.g. Euclidean distance). To test if the use of correlation-based metrics can benefit the recently published clustering techniques for scRNA-seq data, we modified a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) using Pearson’s correlation as a similarity measure and found significant performance improvement over Euclidean distance on scRNA-seq data clustering. These findings demonstrate the importance of similarity metric in clustering scRNA-seq data and highlight Pearson’s correlation as a favourable choice. Further comparison on different scRNA-seq library preparation protocols suggests that they may also affect clustering performance. ",

    "summary": "Housekeeping genes are critical for understanding the core transcriptome and instrumental in data normalisation given their stable expression in different tissues and cells. Previous studies defined housekeeping genes using bulk transcriptome data. With recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is now possible to identify steadily expressed genes across individual cells. Here we introduce the concept of housekeeping index and a framework for assessing housekeeping genes at the single-cell level using high-resolution scRNA-seq data. We apply our approach on two scRNA-seq datasets from early mammalian development and evaluate derived housekeeping genes on ten additional scRNA-seq datasets from diverse cell/tissue types.",
