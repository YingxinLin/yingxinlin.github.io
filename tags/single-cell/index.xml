      <description>Concerted examination of multiple collections of single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data promises further biological insights that cannot be uncovered with individual datasets. However, such integrative analyses are challenging and require sophisticated methodologies. To enable effective interrogation of multiple scRNA-Seq datasets, we have developed a novel algorithm, named scMerge, that removes unwanted variation by combining stably expressed genes and utilizing pseudo-replicates across datasets. Analysis of large collections of publicly available datasets demonstrates that scMerge performs well in multiple scenarios and enhances biological discovery, including inferring cell developmental trajectories.</description>
